# Samples for KFP CI

## Overview
This is a collection of kubeflow pipeline samples to demonstrate CI. Two tools are manipulated to implement the continuous integration process: cloud build and jenkins. We also demonstrate two ways to interact with kfp: kfp sdk and REST API(curl). 

This repo also includes a test to test the sdk client. It test the sdk API by create several pipelines and versions as indicated. You can use it with command line.
